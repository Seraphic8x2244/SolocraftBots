# Development Progress

> Sole live handoff for SoloCraftBots development. Git history carries history; keep this file focused on current constraints, proven behaviour, unresolved questions and the next coherent step.

## Current
- Branch: `dev`
- TOC version: `0.8.97-dev`
- Current implementation head before this handoff update: `ad77dd62dd33b24f44732f5ac82725dda6c9354d`
- Runtime-tested baseline for this slice: `f9760a20c176f5d0123b9f7829fbc5b32e6b93c6` (`0.8.92-dev`; runtime files correspond to implementation `8bd3b38f64a17372b884bf5d58a6a701e45ec84b`)
- Stable `main`: `0.8.78` at `87e61360ec36c2d9543b2e1bc8606b948b10d6bd`; tested dev source `0200cdb5ef59fc0cb4ef81016237d90ba16e22b9`
- `0.8.92-dev` passed the summon/logical-slot/subgroup gate. Do **not** ask the user to repeat the stuck-summon test; they explicitly tested two different 10-player presets and accepted it.
- `0.8.97-dev` contains the direct Feral power-state rebuild and is the next runtime candidate.
- Immediate goal: validate the targeted subgroup-row highlight and revised combat-role evidence UI. Do not reopen accepted summon/rebuild identity work unless a new regression appears.

## Architecture / ownership
- `SoloCraftBots.lua`: bootstrap/core/shared UI/primitives.
- `Presets.lua`: configured preset intent, editor, snapshots, validation and raid-role tracker creation/finalization.
- `Roster.lua`: observed party/raid reality, human/bot classification, Active Roster, provisional spawn assumptions, combat-role evidence and passive layout classification.
- `Spawn.lua`: sole owner of physical roster mutation through `SCB.botOperation`: summon/rebuild, add, subgroup moves, maintenance/refill, bootstrap/survivor handling.
- `Communication.lua`: PartyBot command transport, command semantics, incoming chat/system feedback and preset communications.
- `Options.lua`: settings/help/debug.
- Preserve one physical-operation coordinator. Presentation code must not mutate roster state.

## Authoritative logical / physical model
- A preset slot is intent. A human assigned to logical slot N suppresses exactly that slot's bot class/role intent.
- Party physical order is client-relative and cannot represent shared logical identity. Never warn because a party human is not in their logical absolute row.
- Raid subgroup membership is enforceable with `SetRaidSubgroup()`; exact row/order inside a subgroup is not.
- During raid rebuild, configured humans must be moved to their intended subgroup by name before bot bursts continue. Re-resolve raid indices immediately before each move.
- Human absolute row is irrelevant to bot identity.
- Full rebuilds intentionally burst one logical group at a time. Human-covered assignments are omitted, so a group with two humans and three bot intents summons exactly three bots.
- Preserve the established reverse-send/LIFO behaviour and the existing per-group settle boundary. Do not pack full-rebuild assignments across groups merely to save a burst.
- Final identity is the settled subgroup's **bot-only ordinal order** mapped to uncovered logical assignments in ascending slot order. This is the proven pre-0.8.87 principle from `6bcc9949222513d4f8e38a90d43071149f162f31`.
- Join-line name -> intent binding is provisional/operational identity. It remains important for mixed-group refill, but it must not overwrite settled full-rebuild ordinal identity.

## 0.8.97 implementation
### Full summon / rebuild identity — accepted baseline from 0.8.92
- `SCB_ArrangePresetHumanGroups()` preserves the proven subgroup-preparation rule: humans are resolved by name, moved only between subgroups, then subgroup membership is freshly verified. No row forcing exists.
- Full rebuild queues uncovered assignments group-by-group and uses `PRESET_WAIT_GROUP` between groups.
- `SCB_TryFinalizeRaidRoleTracking()` filters humans, obtains bots by Blizzard subgroup, requires exact per-group bot counts, then maps bot-only ordinal order to assignment order.
- `SCB_PostFinalizeRaidRoleTracking()` does not reconcile settled ordinal identity back through provisional join assumptions.
- `SCB_ReconcileTrackerFromAssumedRoles()` remains defined but has no call sites. Keep cleanup deferred until later.
- Active Roster settled identity outranks provisional `assumedRolesByName`; combat evidence never rewrites intended `slot.role`.

### Passive layout warning
- Party absolute-row mismatch logic remains removed.
- Raid mismatch classification is subgroup-only.
- 0.8.92 runtime: manually moving the user to the wrong raid subgroup correctly produced a warning and the next full Summon put them back into the configured subgroup.
- 0.8.92 presentation problem: the whole-group yellow pulse was so subtle that the user initially thought the build was stale.
- 0.8.93+ presentation change: mismatch classification also returns the exact logical slot(s) whose known member is in the wrong subgroup. Only those character rows receive a stronger gold pulse; the whole group background no longer pulses. The group tooltip remains available.
- This is presentation only; it does not change subgroup correction or physical roster ownership.

### Combat-role validation semantics
- Intended role and combat-confirmed role remain separate state. Evidence never mutates the requested role/preset.
- Validation-eligible classes remain Warrior, Paladin, Shaman, Druid and Priest.
- Rogue/Hunter/Warlock remain excluded. Runtime 0.8.92 confirmed Rogue correctly receives no second validation indicator.
- Mage remains excluded because Fire/Frost are preset specs but both map to `rangedps`; the current role validator cannot honestly distinguish the spec.
- First green tick = SCB bound the bot to that logical assignment.
- Second-indicator semantics remain the user's intended red/yellow/green progression:
  - no role evidence yet: red check = not validated yet;
  - one recognised independent observation: yellow check;
  - two observations agreeing with intended role: green check;
  - confirmed different role: persistent red `X` plus active warning.
- 0.8.94 temporarily removed the red stage-0 tick and broadened the spell catalogue; both were explicitly rejected by the user and reverted in 0.8.95.
- A confirmed mismatch opens a real `StaticPopup` (unless the user has explicitly hidden SCB screen warnings) and also writes the chat warning. The transient 2.4-second centre message is no longer the primary mismatch alert.
- Do not broaden the role-specific spell catalogue without explicit agreement. The original role-spell set is retained.
- Feral Druid validation uses the live power bar directly and does not inspect `Faerie Fire (Feral)` to distinguish bear/cat:
  - rage power type = bear/tank evidence;
  - energy power type = cat/melee evidence;
  - mana power type = no Feral-role evidence, then normal spell evidence may still apply.
- 0.8.96 still sampled the power bar only after combat text identified that Druid as the source. Runtime proved this was the wrong trigger: two bots visibly entered Bear Form while their validation checks remained red outside combat.
- 0.8.97 removes that combat gate. While role validation has pending tracked bots, the existing detection frame directly samples pending Druid unit power every 0.35 seconds. The interval is intentionally just beyond the existing 0.30-second duplicate-observation guard, preserving the established two-observation red -> yellow -> green threshold without introducing a second lifecycle.
- Power evidence remains `Rage power` or `Energy power`; no intended-role value is consulted.
- Full rebuild still starts a fresh role-validation epoch by clearing prior evidence/recent-observation/mismatch-warning state.

## Refill / maintenance contract — unchanged
- Refill intentionally differs from full rebuild: up to five missing/dead assignments may be mixed across destination groups in one burst.
- Keep exact burst intent records, reverse send, join-assumption identity, subgroup movement and Active Roster replacement binding.
- Do not redesign refill into group-by-group bursts; mixed-group refill saves meaningful time.
- Combat-role validation is an independent watchdog for mistaken mixed-burst identity assumptions, not a reason to remove that optimisation.

## Other preserved invariants
- Active Roster keeps logical identity/expected state separate from observation. Human-covered bot slots remain dormant intents; if the human leaves before replacement they become missing; if the human returns before replacement they become covered again.
- After a missing human slot has been replaced by a bot, do not auto-kick/free capacity when the human returns.
- Capacity reuse remains: removal observed absent -> 3.0s settle -> dependent add.
- Bootstrap is continuity-only; reuse an existing bot when possible.
- Maintenance remains `botOperation(kind="maintenance")`; player combat is an absolute block and the existing stale-remote-combat allowance remains.
- Manual Add remains coordinated through `botOperation(kind="manual-add")`.
- Raw user-typed `.partybot add ...` remains outside SCB coordinator ownership.
- Taxi safety remains action-time only through `SCB_CanOperateBots(showError)`.
- Never use `UnitHealth()==0` as a dead-state fallback.
- Preset protocol remains `SCBPRESET` protocol 2; snapshots carry logical composition/human slot intent, never generated bot names.
- Command semantics and tested Ctrl-Come/Move/Stay behaviour are unchanged.

## Runtime results
Exact `0.8.92-dev` baseline:
1. **5-player logical-slot regression: PASS.**
   - User confirmed non-first logical player placement suppresses/replaces the correct underlying bot intent.
   - No invalid party row warning reported.
2. **10-player subgroup + deterministic summon: PASS.**
   - User tested two separate 10-player presets with the player in Group 1 in one preset and Group 2 in the other.
   - No stuck `Preset Summon is already in progress` state.
   - User explicitly does not want this re-tested.
3. **Passive subgroup detection/correction: PASS through 0.8.96.**
   - Manual wrong-subgroup move was detected.
   - Full Summon restored the configured subgroup.
   - 0.8.92 whole-group pulse was too subtle.
   - User runtime-tested the targeted character-box pulse in 0.8.96 and confirmed it is working.
4. **Combat validation: PARTIAL; 0.8.97 Feral power path PASS.**
   - Rogue exclusion passed.
   - Two feral Druids and one DPS Warrior did not accumulate evidence at a reasonable rate while clearing roughly 25% of Stockades at level 60; one feral reached yellow, the others remained stage 0.
   - User observed repeated Feral Faerie Fire, which 0.8.92 ignored because the spell is shared by bear/cat.
   - User also clarified that a genuine mismatch must produce an obvious popup rather than relying on a passive icon/transient centre message.
   - 0.8.96 direct power inference was runtime-tested with two bear Druids: both visibly entered Bear Form but remained red because the read was still combat-text-triggered.
   - 0.8.97 direct-power rebuild is runtime-confirmed: a preset-bound Druid validated as soon as Bear Form/rage appeared, without requiring combat.
   - User also manually joined an unbound Cat Druid after kicking a Rogue. Preset Manager correctly did not show that Druid, a role-validation tick, or a subgroup-warning highlight because it had no preset/logical-slot binding. This is expected behaviour, not a regression.

## Static validation for 0.8.97
- Verified `dev` was still exactly at the 0.8.96 handoff before the write; the implementation update was fast-forward only.
- Reviewed the 0.8.97 diff.
- Confirmed the combat handler no longer performs the Feral power inference.
- Confirmed a single direct scanner now reads pending Druid live unit power through the existing role-detection lifecycle.
- Confirmed the scanner retains the existing two-observation threshold and uses a 0.35-second sample interval, just beyond the existing 0.30-second duplicate guard.
- Confirmed there are zero `Faerie Fire (Feral)` references in `Roster.lua`.
- Confirmed the red stage-0 validation tick remains restored and the unrequested extra Warrior/Druid spells remain absent.
- Canonical Lua 5.0.2 compiler pass is **not claimed** in this environment.

## Focused runtime gate
Test only the new `0.8.97-dev` validation delta. **Do not repeat the accepted 5-man, stuck-10-man, subgroup-highlight or Rogue tests.**

1. **Direct Feral power validation**
   - Bear Form/rage path is **PASS** in 0.8.97 without combat.
   - Cat Form/energy remains unproven for a preset-bound Druid; a manually joined unbound Cat Druid is intentionally outside Preset Manager validation.
   - `Faerie Fire (Feral)` is irrelevant to this path.
   - A mana-form Druid must not receive Feral-role evidence from the power bar.

2. **General combat indicator progression**
   - Still outstanding from the previous gate: for another eligible class/role, red = no evidence, yellow = one recognised observation, green = confirmed after the second.
   - A red `X` is distinct from the red pending check and means a confirmed mismatch.

3. **Mismatch alert**
   - If a genuine confirmed role disagreement occurs naturally, confirm the persistent red `X` is accompanied by an actual popup plus chat warning.
   - Runtime proof remains opportunistic; do not engineer a mismatch solely for this gate.

## Deferred / later
- Resummon Group through the existing maintenance/bot-operation lifecycle.
- Audit remaining All-row/server target sensitivity.
- Remove only proven-dead legacy refill/compatibility code after runtime proof.
- Add neutral read-only activity/status surface, then visualiser as a presentation-only consumer.
- Historical regression debt: dungeon -> 10-player scope retest; Replace Dead focused smoke; investigate dead-state observation only if the old omitted-dead-bot case recurs.

## Release note
Do not promote the current dev line. Stable remains `0.8.78` on `main`. Release preparation must compare `main` and `dev` rather than overwrite main because histories have diverged.
